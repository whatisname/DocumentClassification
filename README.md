Performance of various ML algorithms on Document Classification

# 1. [Build Naïve Bayes Model for Document Tagging](https://github.com/whatisname/DocumentClassification/tree/master/multipleTags)

## Introduction

The main task of this project is to design a program that accept a training dataset of labeled documents to train a Naïve Bayes classifier to classify new documents with satisficing accuracy. The program implements Naïve Bayes algorithm to perform probabilistic prediction on its input. Thus in this program, the assumption is that each word is individual from each other in training and testing datasets. The algorithm is totally implemented in Python language, by which I could build several different modules for the purpose of scalability and reusability. Code of three modules are in Attachment.
